# AirDrop Simulator

An electronic payload drop simulator developed with an **STM32** microcontroller, using a graphical display and physical buttons to control the simulation.  
The system calculates the ideal moment to release the load based on the aircraft’s speed, altitude, and the target's position.

This repository also includes a **Python** version made with **Pygame**, created for testing and learning purposes.
